## Overview

Convert selected text into speech. 

The plugin uses [guessLanguage](http://richtr.github.io/guessLanguage.js/) to recognize the language and the [ResponsiveVoice service](https://responsivevoice.org/) to read the text out loud. By default, it uses a female voice. 

The Speech plugin is installed by default in cloud and [self-hosted](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer) of ONLYOFFICE editors. 

## How to use

1. Highlight the phrase you want to here.
2. Open the Plugins tab and press Speech.
