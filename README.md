# Speech plugin

The Speech plugin allows users to have text documents read out loud to them, by converting the selected text passage into speech.

The plugin uses Yandex.Translate to recognize the language and the [ResponsiveVoice service](https://responsivevoice.org/) to read the text out loud. By default, it uses a female voice. 

The plugin is pre-installed in ONLYOFFICE Enterprise Edition, Community Edition (Document Server + Community Server), ONLYOFFICE Integration Edition, ONLYOFFICE cloud service, and ONLYOFFICE Personal.

## How to use

1. Highlight the phrase you want to hear.
2. Open the Plugins tab and press Speech.
